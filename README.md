# Red/Black Tree Visualizer

## Description
This project is an implementation of the Red-Black Tree data structure in the Java programming language. The Red-Black Tree is a type of self-balancing binary search tree, which is highly efficient for data storage and retrieval. This implementation includes not just the standard tree operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching but also additional functionalities like determining the minimum and maximum nodes, successors, and predecessors.

## Objectives

The main goal of implementing the Red-Black Tree in Java is to develop an efficient and balanced data structure for fast data management and access. Specific objectives of the project include:

- **Correct Implementation of the Red-Black Tree Structure**:
    - Creating a binary search tree structure that adheres to all the specific rules and properties of a Red-Black Tree.
    - Ensuring the tree's balance by appropriately coloring the nodes and performing the necessary rotations.

- **Development of Insertion, Deletion, and Search Functions**:
    - Creating efficient algorithms for inserting and deleting nodes in the tree while maintaining its balance.
    - Implementing a search function that allows for the quick finding of nodes by key.

- **Creation of Auxiliary Methods for Users**:
    - Implementing functions for finding the minimum and maximum nodes, as well as the successor and predecessor of a given node.
    - Developing methods for visualizing the tree structure, such as indented display or in-order traversals.

- **Performance Optimization**:
    - Minimizing memory use through efficient management of nodes and their connections.

## Functionalities

The implementation of the Red-Black Tree in Java offers a wide range of functionalities.

1. **Node Addition**:
   - Allows the user to add a new node to the tree.

2. **Node Deletion**:
   - Enables the user to delete a specified node from the tree.

3. **Minimum Node Retrieval**:
   - Returns the node with the minimum value in the tree.

4. **Maximum Node Retrieval**:
   - Displays the node with the maximum value in the tree.

5. **Successor Retrieval of a Node**:
   - Determines the successor of a specified node in the tree.

6. **Predecessor Retrieval of a Node**:
   - Finds the predecessor of a given node.

7. **Tree Structure Display**:
   - Visualizes the current structure of the Red-Black Tree.

8. **In-Order Traversal Display**:
   - Performs and displays the in-order traversal of the tree.

9. **Black Height of the Tree Display**:
   - Calculates and displays the black height of the tree.

10. **Maximum Key of a Black Node Display**:
    - Identifies and displays the maximum key of a black node in the tree.

11. **Maximum Key of a Red Node Display**:
    - Determines and displays the maximum key of a red node in the tree.

12. **Tree Depth Display**:
    - Calculates and presents the depth of the tree.

13. **Exit Program**:
    - Provides the user with the option to exit the program.
